Handling Post Requests :-
1. SetUp post request route to get some response.
2. Parse Post request data. 

Object Oriented Programming 
To Structure our code : 
1. Prototypes
2. New Operator
3. Constructors
4. Classes
5. keywords(extends, super)

Object Prototypes 
-> Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript Objects inherit features from one another. It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from, without having their own copy. 

arr._proto_(reference)
Array.Prototype(actual object)
String.Prototype 

Every Object in JavaScript has a built-in Property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own Prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
